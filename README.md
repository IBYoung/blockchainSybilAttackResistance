# Blockchain-based Sybil Attack Resistance Protocol

Blockchain-based Sybil Attack Resistance Protocol is a proof of concept of a protocol that prevents Sybil attacks in any decentralized system using a adapted version of the blockchain technology. Each block contains only the identity of a peer and expires after some time. As opposed to the common blockchain, we propose a way to use a completely scalable blockchain, where the number of blocks never exceeds the number of peers and where there is no need to resolve collisions of concurrent block mining.

This project was done for the course "Decentralized Systems Engineering" at EPFL. The goal was to enhance a decentralized chat and file sharing application that we implemented in previous projects with a protocol to resist against Sybil attacks.
